# The C++ Programming Language - Study Guide

This repository contains all my personal code and notes as I work my way through the fourth edition of [The C++ Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840) by Bjarne Stroustrup.

## About The Book

"The C++ Programming Language" is written by the creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup. This book is widely regarded as the definitive reference for C++ programmers of all skill levels. The fourth edition of the book, which this repository is based upon, includes detailed information about the latest C++11 standard.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured as follows:

* Each chapter of the book has its own directory.
* Within each directory, there are subdirectories for 'code' and 'notes'.
* The 'code' directory contains all code snippets and programs that I wrote while working through the chapter.
* The 'notes' directory contains a summary of the chapter, as well as my personal thoughts and observations.

## How to Use this Repository

This repository is meant to be a supplement to "The C++ Programming Language," not a replacement. I highly encourage you to purchase the book and read along.

Feel free to browse through my code and notes. They might not always be perfect, as they are a reflection of my personal learning journey.
